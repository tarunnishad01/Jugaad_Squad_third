      "question": "What defines a linear system in Simulink simulations?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Output grows quadratically with input",
        "b": "Output is independent of input",
        "c": "Output is directly proportional to input",
        "d": "Input and output are always constant"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Quadratic growth is a sign of non-linearity.",
        "b": "Incorrect. A system where output is independent of input is not useful.",
        "c": "Correct! In linear systems, output scales linearly with input. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearity'>Learn more</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect. Linearity does not mean constant values."

      "question": "Which Simulink block is commonly used to visualize signals over time?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Gain",
        "b": "Integrator",
        "c": "Scope",
        "d": "Mux"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Gain is used for multiplying signals.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Integrator is for mathematical integration.",
        "c": "Correct! The Scope block allows visualization of signal waveforms. <a href='https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/scope.html'>More here</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect. Mux is for combining signals, not displaying them."

      "question": "What is a key feature of a non-linear system?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Superposition holds true",
        "b": "The system output is directly proportional to input",
        "c": "Output response varies non-proportionally to input",
        "d": "It always produces a sinusoidal output"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Superposition is only valid for linear systems.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is true for linear, not non-linear systems.",
        "c": "Correct! In non-linear systems, input-output relationship is not proportional. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system'>More info</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect. Non-linear systems can produce distorted or unexpected outputs."

      "question": "Which input signal is best to test system linearity in Simulink?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Random noise",
        "b": "Step function",
        "c": "Sine wave",
        "d": "Pulse generator"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Noise does not clearly indicate linearity.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Step function tests response time, not linearity.",
        "c": "Correct! A sine wave helps analyze proportional output response in linearity tests. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave'>More here</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect. Pulse is used for digital system timing, not linearity."

    {
      "question": "What indicates that a system is non-linear in a Simulink experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Output waveform is identical to input",
        "b": "Output amplitude increases linearly with input",
        "c": "Output does not scale proportionally with input",
        "d": "Input is constant but output varies linearly"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This indicates linearity or a system with no change.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This describes linear behavior.",
        "c": "Correct! Non-linearity is shown when input changes result in disproportionate output. <a href='https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/'>More on Simulink</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect. A constant input typically doesn't lead to variation unless the system has feedback."
