      "question": "What is the main benefit of using QPSK over BPSK in digital communication?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It reduces bandwidth",
        "b": "It increases power consumption",
        "c": "It allows higher data rate",
        "d": "It uses fewer components"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. QPSK does not reduce bandwidth compared to BPSK.",
        "b": "Incorrect. QPSK does not necessarily increase power consumption.",
        "c": "Correct! QPSK allows transmission of 2 bits per symbol, effectively doubling the data rate. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_phase-shift_keying'>More info</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect. The number of components is generally the same."

      "question": "What happens to BER as the modulation order (M) increases in M-ary PSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "BER remains constant",
        "b": "BER decreases",
        "c": "BER increases",
        "d": "BER is not affected"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. BER does not stay the same with increased modulation order.",
        "b": "Incorrect. BER usually increases with higher M due to reduced phase separation.",
        "c": "Correct! As M increases, symbols are closer, making them more prone to errors. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-ary_transmission'>More info</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect. BER is affected by modulation complexity."

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is true about Bit Error Rate (BER)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It is measured in volts",
        "b": "It represents the ratio of incorrect bits to total bits sent",
        "c": "It increases with higher SNR",
        "d": "It is only relevant in analog modulation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. BER is a ratio, not a voltage.",
        "b": "Correct! BER is the number of incorrect bits divided by the total number of transmitted bits. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_error_rate'>Read more</a>",
        "c": "Incorrect. Higher SNR usually reduces BER.",
        "d": "Incorrect. BER is a key metric in digital communication."

      "question": "Why is Gray coding used in digital modulation schemes like QPSK or 8-PSK?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To save energy",
        "b": "To reduce frequency usage",
        "c": "To minimize bit errors due to symbol errors",
        "d": "To increase data compression"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Gray coding does not primarily save energy.",
        "b": "Incorrect. It doesnâ€™t reduce frequency usage.",
        "c": "Correct! Gray coding ensures only one bit changes between adjacent symbols, reducing bit error probability. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code'>Learn more</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect. Gray coding is not related to compression."

      "question": "What is a key characteristic of QPSK modulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It transmits one bit per symbol",
        "b": "It uses amplitude variation only",
        "c": "It represents data using four phase shifts",
        "d": "It cannot be used for wireless communication"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. QPSK transmits two bits per symbol.",
        "b": "Incorrect. QPSK uses phase variation, not amplitude.",
        "c": "Correct! QPSK uses four phase states to encode two bits per symbol. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_phase-shift_keying'>More here</a>",
        "d": "Incorrect. QPSK is commonly used in wireless systems."
