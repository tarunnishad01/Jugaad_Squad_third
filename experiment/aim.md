### Aim of the experiment
To design and simulate systems in Simulink for analyzing the linearity and non-linearity of dynamic systems through visual and interactive simulations, and to understand how linear and non-linear behaviors affect system response.

Objective Highlights:

* To develop models for both linear and non-linear systems using Simulink blocks.

* To observe system response to different inputs (step, sine, ramp, etc.).

* To perform a linearity test using the principle of superposition (homogeneity and additivity).

* To visually compare output waveforms for linear vs. non-linear models.

* To enhance conceptual understanding of system behavior using interactive simulations.
