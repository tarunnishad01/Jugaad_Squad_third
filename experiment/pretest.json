    "question": "In Simulink, the linearity test is performed to determine:",
    "answers": {
      "a": "The stability of the system",
      "b": "The input-output relationship of the system",
      "c": "The speed of the system",
      "d": "None of the above"
    },
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect. Stability is a different characteristic, often tested separately.",
      "b": "Correct! Linearity tests help analyze if the output is directly proportional to the input.",
      "c": "Incorrect. Speed or performance is not the focus of linearity testing.",
      "d": "Incorrect. One of the options correctly defines the purpose."
    },

    "question": "If the output does not increase proportionally with the input, the system is called:",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Linear",
      "b": "Non-linear",
      "c": "Stable",
      "d": "None of the above"
    },
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect. A linear system has proportional input-output behavior.",
      "b": "Correct! Non-linear systems do not exhibit a proportional input-output relationship.",
      "c": "Incorrect. Stability is not directly related to linearity.",
      "d": "Incorrect. One of the options is the correct classification."

  {
    "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Scope' block in Simulink?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "To generate input signals",
      "b": "To perform calculations",
      "c": "To view output signals",
      "d": "To save data"
    },
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect. Signal generators like 'Sine Wave' are used for inputs.",
      "b": "Incorrect. Blocks like Gain, Sum, or Math Function perform calculations.",
      "c": "Correct! The Scope block is used to visualize simulation output signals.",
      "d": "Incorrect. Logging blocks or 'To File' blocks handle data saving."

    "question": "Which types of input signals are suitable for linearity testing in Simulink?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Sine wave",
      "b": "Step signal",
      "c": "Ramp signal",
      "d": "All of the above"
    },
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Partially correct. Sine waves are commonly used but not the only option.",
      "b": "Partially correct. Step signals help in testing system response.",
      "c": "Partially correct. Ramp signals are good for analyzing trends.",
      "d": "Correct! All of these signal types can be used for linearity testing depending on the context."

  {
    "question": "What is a characteristic of a non-linear system in Simulink modeling?",
    "answers": {
      "a": "Superposition principle holds",
      "b": "Output changes proportionally with input",
      "c": "Output has a complex relationship with input",
      "d": "All options are correct"
    },
    "explanations": {
      "a": "Incorrect. Superposition is valid only for linear systems.",
      "b": "Incorrect. Proportionality is a trait of linear systems.",
      "c": "Correct! Non-linear systems exhibit complex, non-proportional behavior.",
      "d": "Incorrect. Only one of the options accurately describes a non-linear system."
