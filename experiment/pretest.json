      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! QPSK stands for Quadrature Phase Shift Keying. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-shift_keying'>Learn more</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is not the correct expansion of QPSK.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is a misleading term.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is not a standard modulation scheme."

      "question": "In M-ary PSK, what does 'M' represent?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The number of transmitters",
        "b": "The number of possible phase shifts",
        "c": "The number of receivers",
        "d": "The number of channels"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. M is unrelated to the number of transmitters.",
        "b": "Correct! 'M' in M-ary PSK indicates the number of distinct phase shifts. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-ary_transmission'>More info</a>",
        "c": "Incorrect. M does not refer to receivers.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. BPSK uses only two phases.",
        "b": "Incorrect. 8-PSK uses eight phases.",
        "c": "Correct! QPSK uses four phase shifts. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_phase-shift_keying'>Reference</a>",

      "question": "What is the role of BER in digital modulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase signal power",
        "b": "To define modulation order",
        "c": "To measure data compression",
        "d": "To quantify transmission errors"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. BER does not increase power.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Modulation order is separate from BER.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Compression and BER are different metrics.",
        "d": "Correct! BER (Bit Error Rate) measures the number of bit errors. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_error_rate'>Learn more</a>"

        "c": "Clock speed",
        "d": "User interface design"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! SNR directly impacts the number of errors in received data. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio'>More here</a>",
        "b": "Incorrect. While cable length may influence loss, SNR is more direct.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Clock speed affects timing, not BER directly.",
        "d": "Incorrect. UI design does not impact BER."
